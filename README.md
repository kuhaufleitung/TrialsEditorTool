# TrialsEditorTool

TrialsEditorTool is a little program for Trials Fusion which lets you port Tracks from Track Central to the Editor.
Keep in mind this is a very early implementation of it, so thing can still be buggy.

# Install

If you want to compile it yourself just download the files and open it in Visual Studio. There are no external frameworks or libraries, so it should compile without errors.

Binaries are also uploaded.

# IMPORTANT

There has to be AT LEAST ONE track created in the Editor by yourself.

Please check the created config file and its path to both directories.
The config is located at the same directory where the TrialsEditorTool.exe is located at.

# TODO

- Sorting the tracklist
- better looking font
- Rising/Evo Support
