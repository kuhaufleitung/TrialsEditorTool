# TrialsEditorTool

TrialsEditorTool is a little program for Trials Evo GE/Fusion which lets you port Tracks from Track Central to the Editor.
In order to port a track you have to mark it as a favorite it so it gets downloaded.


# Install

If you want to compile it, just download the files and open it in Visual Studio. There are no external frameworks or libraries, so it should compile without errors.

Binaries are also uploaded.

# IMPORTANT

There has to be AT LEAST ONE track created in the Editor created with your own account.

Please check the created config file and its path to both directories.
The config is located at the same directory where the TrialsEditorTool.exe is located at.
